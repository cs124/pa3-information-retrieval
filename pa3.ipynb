    "In this assignment you will be improving upon a rather poorly-made information retrieval system. You will build an inverted index to quickly retrieve documents that match queries and then make it even better by using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency weighting and cosine similarity to compare queries to your data set. Your IR system will be evaluated for accuracy on the correct documents retrieved for different queries and the correctly computed tf-idf values and cosine similarities."

The training data is located in the `data/` directory under the subdirectory `ProjectGutenberg/`. Within this directory you will see yet another directory `raw/`. This contains the raw text files of the sixty books. The `data/` directory also contains the files `dev_queries.txt` and `dev_solutions.txt`.

    "\n",
    "<b>Inverted Index:</b> Implement an inverted index - a mapping from words to the documents in which they occur and the count of how many times each word appears in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>TF-IDF:</b> Compute and store the term-frequency inverse-document-frequency value for every word-document co-occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cosine Similarity:</b> Implement cosine similarity in order to improve upon the ranked retrieval system, which currently retrieves documents based upon the Jaccard coefficient between the query and each document. Note that when computing $w_{t, q}$ (i.e. the weight for the word 𝑤 in the query) do not include the idf term. That is, $w_{t, q} = 1 + \\log_{10} \\text{tf}_{t, q}$. Normalize by both the query and document vector lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dense Retrieval:</b> Use pre-computed BERT embeddings to implement dense retrieval. You will implement cosine similarity for dense vectors and a function to retrieve the top-k most similar documents given a query embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Reflection:</b> Compare TF-IDF and dense retrieval methods, reflecting on their strengths and weaknesses."

The provided development queries contain some common words, some uncommon words, and the occasional non-existent word. Some of the query phrases are found verbatim in the book dataset, and some are not. Your system should be able to correctly handle all of these cases."

    "## Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build our information retrieval system, we need to understand **text preprocessing** — the steps we take to normalize text before indexing and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our IR system applies the following preprocessing pipeline to all documents and queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lowercase**: Convert all text to lowercase (\"The\" → \"the\")\n",
    "2. **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words on whitespace\n",
    "3. **Remove non-alphanumeric**: Strip punctuation and special characters\n",
    "4. **Stemming**: Reduce words to their root form using the Porter Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Stemming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is crucial for information retrieval. Consider the query \"running shoes\":\n",
    "- Without stemming: Only matches documents containing exactly \"running\"\n",
    "- With stemming: \"running\" → \"run\", which also matches \"runs\", \"ran\", \"runner\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This dramatically improves **recall** — our ability to find all relevant documents. The Porter Stemmer we use applies rules like:\n",
    "- \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
    "- \"machines\" → \"machin\"\n",
    "- \"learning\" → \"learn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing is already implemented in the `IRSystem` class above. When you build your inverted index, you'll be working with already-stemmed tokens."
